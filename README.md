# glitter - Personal Blockchain Social Network

## Overview

This project is a prototype for a decentralized social network built on personal blockchains with zero-knowledge proof capabilities. It aims to provide a privacy-preserving platform for social interactions, similar to LinkedIn, but without exposing unnecessary personal data.
Key features:

* Personal blockchain for each user
* Peer-to-peer network simulation
* Digital signatures for data authenticity
* Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving validation
* Simple consensus mechanism
* Data propagation across the network

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* cryptography library
* Hypothetical zk_snark library (placeholder in the current implementation)
