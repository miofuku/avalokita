## Key features:

* Personal blockchain for each user
* Peer-to-peer network simulation
* Digital signatures for data authenticity
* Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving validation
* Simple consensus mechanism
* Data propagation across the network

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Dependencies listed in requirements.txt
